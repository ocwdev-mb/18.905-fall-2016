Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_18.701 Algebra I_](/courses/18-701-algebra-i-fall-2010) or [_18.703 Modern Algebra_](/courses/18-703-modern-algebra-spring-2013); and [_18.901 Introduction to Topology_](/courses/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004)

Familiarity with topological spaces, covering spaces, and the fundamental group will be assumed, as well as comfort with the structure of finitely generated modules over a PID.

Description
-----------

This is a course on the singular homology of topological spaces. Topics include: Singular homology, CW complexes, Homological algebra, Cohomology, and Poincare duality.

Textbook
--------

There are lots of textbooks that treat algebraic topology more or less at the level of this course.
